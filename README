This is the Quick and Dirty Trajectory Analysis PyMOL script.

As of now, it consists of the function traj_plot, which allows to plot any function of one or more  pymol selection (that returns one number) against the
the states of the selection.

A couple of functions are implemented in the class MD. For instance, if you feed traj_plot with a reference selection, a test selection and the function MD.RMSD, it will plot the RMSD of the test vs the reference along all states for the test, vs the state number. It should be trivial to implement your own functions (and feel free to pull-request if you implemente something you think is useful!)

In addition to PyMOL, the script requires Numpy and Matplotlib. Unfortunately, it has only been tested in Python 3, with which PyMOL is compiled in Fedora. I believe it will work on Python 2 also. If it doesn't and you want to fix that, I'll be happy to add a new Python2 branch.

Everything is done in a quick and dirty(tm) way, hence the name. Sorry about that :-)
